## Description

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a popular game. Two players choose one of the symbols (scissors, rock or paper) and show it simultaneously when called. Each symbol is superior to another symbol. If both players choose the same symbol, there is a draw. In this case, the game is repeated.

The winner receives one point for each game won. After a predetermined condition, e.g. (best out of 3; first to 10; number of games; ...) a player wins the round.

1. The application is writte in Python and supports human players, computer-controlled players, and an LLM (Language Model) player.
2. The rule variants available should be the classic Scissors, Rock, Paper variant and an extended variant with the addition of Spock and Lizard.
